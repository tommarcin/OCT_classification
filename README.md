# Classification of OCT images of the human eye using mobile devices

The Android application designed for the classification of OCT images was developed using the Kotlin programming language within the Android Studio integrated development environment. With the application, classification can be performed on an image chosen 10
from the user’s files or an image acquired using the photo-taking function. The results of the classification are displayed for three neural networks, along with the respective classification times for each neural network and the associated image undergoing the classification task.
